- The presence of conversations depends on the presence of messages.
- Uploaded files depend on the Users because without the users uploading there will be no files on out
  database

  can only exist if there is a department, course and a listing post associated with it.
- Role in a Relationsip: There is a role of User1 and User2 in the Talks to relation because two users need to be messaging each other in the conversation.
