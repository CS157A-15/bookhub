Project Description:
  The application will allow students to make an account on a website and sell books that they are not using. Users will have the 
  ability to put up books that they do not need on sale and other students who need those books can buy it from those sellers. The 
  stakeholders for this application will be the students who put up their books for sale and the students who buy the books using the 
  website. The application depends on the stakeholders to put up books and buy books. College textbooks are expensive, and a lot of 
  students have a hard time buying new books. This application is important for the students who cannot afford new books because they 
  can buy books from their peers for a cheaper price, and it is also beneficial for the environment because it puts books to maximum 
  utilization and reduces waste. This application will also help students make money from their old textbooks by selling it to their 
  peers.

3-Tier Architecure
	- Tier 1 : Client 
		- We will be using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap
	- Tier 2: Server
		- We will be using Apache with the JDBC plugin so it can run on Java.
	- Tier 3: Database
		- For database we will be using the Oracle open source MySql and we will be accessing the modifying the contents of the database through SQL.

Functional Requirements:
	- How will the user be accessing the system?
		The users will be accessing this sytems through the web since this is a web application to make it available across all platforms(iOS, Windows, Linus). Users are able to browse through the website searching for books they want to buy from users who are selling. They are free to browse through the catalogue. If a user wants to buy a specific book, they would have to create an account on the website to obtain access to contact the seller through direct message hosted by the web application. It will be up to the seller and the buyer to either exchange personal information such each of their Venmo names or meet up in person to change their goods. That way we can keep the seller’s identity and have the users be in control of the information they want others to have about them. Upon entering the site, the user is greeted with a search bar without the prompt for creating an account or singing into a current account. The user will be prompted to do so after they click on a book listing. This is because of our policy of allowing the seller and buyer to disclose their information within the web application through direct message rather than posting it under the book listing. Login should be easy if we can tie it to San Jose State’s One Login.

	-Describe the different functions, functional processes and I/O
		- Posting a book listing
			- All users should be able to post a booklisting on the site and notfiy the other users of their listed item and the item's price.
			- The website should make creating a listing extremely easy to make listing to maintain our user populations.
		
		- Ensuring the that the book posted is for the correct class
			- To ensure that the user is posting the correct listing to the correct location in the database, the user will have to pick the department and  the course that the book belongs to and post his/her listing under that premise. This would be easier than use writing an algorithm to figure out where the book should go if we just allow the user to push their listing onto our database and have us organize the databse everytime someone posts something.
		
		- Searching through the database
			- To search for a book, the user can either search by the name of the book within the search bar or use the dropdowns within the search bar. One or both of those options are acceptable and the user will be given a visual cue, as we will initially have the search button deactivated until the user inputs an acceptable search item.  When the search is complete, the user will see a card for a single listing for the book or books- depending on the search criteria- the user is looking for. If there are no listing for the book, the user will be greeted with a page stating that the book is not available at our site currently.
			- If there are result from the search, users are able to order the search by low to high price or vise versa. The user can also order by posting date, putting the most recent post first or the older posts first. Maybe some of the old posts are already sold but the original poster forgot to remove their post after the transaction is complete. That would be a useful way to sort the listings according the user's preference.

		- Marking a post as sold
			- Users who post book listings should be able to mark their listings as completed (sold) or available. Since, we do not control how the seller get and paid or how the buyer would like to the pay the seller, the program cannot automatically mark the book listing as sold or available. If we were in control of monetary transactions, we would mark a certain listing as complete once the payment is made to the seller through our site. Since we are moving the payment option off our site, leaving the buyer and seller to decided whether the buyer would either pay over Venmo, PayPal or cash in person, we dont know when the transction is completed, so the seller would have to take on the responsiblility to mark their listings as sold.
			- Should the seller forget to mark their listsings as sold and a user tries to buy the sold item, the user who is buying the already sold product has the abililty to alert both the administrator(us) and the seller to update the listing. Maybe when the buyer is talking to the seller, the seller tells the buyer it's sold and will mark the listing as sold. 
			- Another way to prevent have listings that are sold on the search list would be to have the seller and potential buy to schedule a meeting day to echange the book inperson on campus or around the campus. That way after their meeting we can send them a reminder notification/email to remind them to mark their listing as sold. Or we will just mark it as sold after the day after buyer-seller meetup. There scheduling option, can allow them to change and reschedule to ensure that we are not immaturely marking listings as sold.

		- Communication between the seller and the buyer
			- This feature would require two different features: a profile page to be able to find users to start a conversation and a messaging feature.

			- The profile page:
				-The profile page allows the user to put a description about themselve such as their major and a profile picture- but not required. Every new user will have a standard profile page with a standard profile picture. Within the profile page is a button for other users to click to start a conversation with the user whose profile page the other user is on.
			- The messaging feature:
				- Users are able to mesage other users on the platform through our messaging system. The messages button will lie in on the top right corner next to the log out button to make the feature more accessible. The user should able to see the list of their past messages upon click on 'messages' button. The messages will be deleted a year from the start of the conversation between the two users.
			- The exchange of physical goods:
				- The exchange of books should take place in a location at which both users had agreed upon.
				- Users will meet up and exchange goods and part their way. 
				- There is no intervention in our part.

Non-functional Issues
-	Graphical User Interface: The website will have a search bar and all the navigation bar tools at the top. The navigation bar will 
include dropdown menu for department and course number along with Sign In button. If we are not able to use San Jose State Login, we 
will have another button on navigation bar for Sign Up. The landing page will include this navigation bar at the top with the featured 
books list displayed horizontally under the navigation bar. Following the featured books list will be the most popular books of the 
week. There will be another horizontal list for the cheapest books. If the user lands on the front page with logged-in then the popular, 
cheapest and featured books will be from the same department the user belongs to. The books will be displayed as cards where the picture 
on the book will be at the top half of the card and the description of the book will be at the bottom half of the card. The image of the 
seller will also be added to the card near the bottom in a fixed size circle. The seller image will be small so that it will not affect 
the UI of the book which is the main focus of the buyer. After searching for a book in the search bar, the books will be listed in 
cards, and the user can click on the sorting dropdown menu which will be placed at the top right corner to sort the books. When the user 
clicks on a book, the sign in form will pop-up if the user is not signed in; if the user is signed in, he or she may message the seller 
about the book. The UI will be very simple and will make heavy use of cards to display books. 

-	The Security: To protect students from scammers, the website will only allow access to San Jose State Students. The use of Okta for 
signup is due to the security reason. If we are not able to use Okta for signup, we will make the use of San Jose State email for 
signup. Another security feature is the messaging feature which will ensure that the personal phone number of each user stays private 
unless the user is comfortable giving it to other students. The messages will be kept private and will only be visible to the sender and 
the receiver.

-	Access Control: Most of the information about the user will be kept private other than the username and listings. The built-in
messaging feature is suppose to recieve messages from any other user from SJSU Book Hub. Any person visiting the website will have 
access to the book listing, but only registered users will be able to message the seller thought the messaging feature. If the seller is 
viewing books listing and stumbles up on his or her own book in the listing, the seller has access to delete the listing from there 
wihtout having to go to profile and delete it. All users will have the same access control, but the admin will have control over 
deleting any listing from the database or adding any listing back.
